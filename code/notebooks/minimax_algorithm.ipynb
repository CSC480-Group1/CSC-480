    "Here are the basic steps for the algorithm:\n",
    "- Find all available moves for the player (min or max)\n",
    "- If there are no moves:\n",
    "  - Return the board state as a \"score\" -- we call this our **utility** function\n",
    "- For each possible move:\n",

    "  - If the score returned is better than any previous score:\n",
    "    - New best score is that one\n",
    "- Return best score\n",
    "\n",
    "### Some complexities\n",
    "This is the general outline of the algorithm. One thing that still needs to be implemented is how being min vs max differs for a score. This is important, since if our player is black and minimax returns say `1.0` as a win for black and `1.0` as a win for white, both seem like valid moves. However, we want to make the move that returns to us a win for black here.\n",

    "To do this, let's make some assumptions: a larger score is better for max and a smaller score is better for min.\n",

    "Then we can say `-1.0` may be a win for white and `1.0` would be a win for black in the case mentioned above.\n",
    "\n",

    "- Call minimax on new board state.\n",
    "- If player is max and the returned score is **larger** than any other we've seen before, our new best move is the one we made above.\n",

    "### Answer this before reading on!\n",
    "\n",
    "Ok, in the above we see that black made the right moves to win. But why didn't it just choose column 2 to begin with a win?\n",
    "\n",
    "</question>\n",
    "\n",
    "<answer>\n",
    "\n",
    "The reason why is because we aren't picking the choice that leads to the fastest best game outcome, just to the one that leads to a best outcome in general. There can be different ways to do that as we see above. Black can play either 0 or 2 as a move and still win if it plays optimally afterwards. For that reason, the choice black makes is arbitrary.\n",
