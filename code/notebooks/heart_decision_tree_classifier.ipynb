    "This actually has to do with at least 2 things: when we decide to stop with building our tree (if we return when the infromation gain of the best split is 0) and how we decide which class from the target to choose if there is equal amount of both. If we vary those 2 things, our validation may be better. This is more luck based on the dataset then it is practically better. Can you think of ways to optimize this behavior? \n",
